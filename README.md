# evermarkable

A Go-based Application to Sync Evernote and Remarkable

## Current State

It seems like this project may never come to fruition unfortunately because the reMarkable API and formats are too
proprietary and seem to also change frequently.

It's pretty impressive the work that other people have done in this space like Javier Uruen Val (juruen) and Davis
Remmel (author of [RCU](http://www.davisr.me/projects/rcu/)). They've managed to reverse engineer many parts of the API
and reMarkable format spec and have both supported projects that do so for several years.

Unfortunately, I just don't have it in me to spend as much time as would be required to get this done and keep it
updated across the endless reMarkable updates. As such I will likely archive this project.

This project is under active development and is not currently at a place where it performs its function.

The current effort is going towards implementing the remarkable API, after that I'll begin work on the Evernote API.

After that work concludes then the syncing will need to occur.

Stay tuned for updates on the project as I go along!

## Attribution and Thanks

All of the initial inspiration for this project was based on the now unmaintained project [rmapi](https://github.com/juruen/rmapi)

A huge thanks to @juruen for all of the work that he put into that project over many years!
Without the work that he did on that project, this project wouldn't exist today.
