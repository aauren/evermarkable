A Go-based Application to Sync Evernote and Remarkable

## Current State

This project is under active development and is not currently at a place where it performs its function.

The current effort is going towards implementing the remarkable API, after that I'll begin work on the Evernote API.

After that work concludes then the syncing will need to occur.

Stay tuned for updates on the project as I go along!

## Attribution and Thanks

All of the initial inspiration for this project was based on the now unmaintained project [rmapi](https://github.com/juruen/rmapi)

A huge thanks to @juruen for all of the work that he put into that project over many years!
Without the work that he did on that project, this project wouldn't exist today.
